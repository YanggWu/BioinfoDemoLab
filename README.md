# software-test
This repository contains a series of test data and output results from commonly used bioinformatics software. We provide multiple running examples (demos) aimed at demonstrating the basic functions and usage methods of these tools. These resources will be very useful for users who want to learn how to operate these tools or test their functionalities.

**Features:**

- Test Datasets: Small FASTQ files and other sequence data suitable for quick tests and educational purposes.
- Tool Demonstrations: Scripts and workflows demonstrating the use of popular bioinformatics software like HISAT2, STAR, and Samtools.
